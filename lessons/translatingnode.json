In order to get the coordinates of the point, imagine that the line is the hypotenuse of a right triangle. The angle of a line is equal to the inverse tangent of the slope so the coordiantes are (l*cos(tan⁻¹(m)), l*sin(tan⁻¹(m)) + b) where l is the distance along the line, m is the slope and b is the y-intercept. Using the values given in the example, the point is at (1*cos(tan⁻¹(1)), 1*sin(tan⁻¹(1)) + 0) = (cos45°, sin45°) = (√2/2, √2/2)"
