            "textAfter": "In this example, the center is at the origin and the radius is 1. The minimum angle is 45° and the maximum angle is 135° and the node is halfway between the two angles. First it is necessary to get the angle of the node using linear interpolation, since when the percentage is 0% the node is directly at the minimum angle and when it is 100% the node is directly at the maximum angle, the angle of the node is a * (1 - t) + b * t where a is the minimum angle, b is the maximum angle and t is the percentage. If the node is halfway, the percentage is 50% or 0.5 so the angle is 45° * (1 - 0.5) + 135° * 0.5 = 22.5° + 67.5° = 90°. After finding the angle of the node, get the position using (r*cosΘ + x, r*sinΘ + y) where x and y is the center point. In this example, the radius is 1 and the center is (0,0) so the position is (cos90°, sin90°) = (0, 1)."
